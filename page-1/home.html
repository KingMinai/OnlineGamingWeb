	  <h2>What is an Online game?</h2>
	  <img class="card-image" src="images/example.jpg">
	  <p>
	    An online game is a video game that is played through the Internet or any
	    other computer network available. Online games are ubiquitous on modern gaming
	    platforms, and span many genres, including first-person shooters, strategy
	    games and massively multiplayer online role-playing games.
	    <br/><br/>
	    The main diffirences between “normal” (Offline games) are that offline games
	    made to be played locally on a single console/computer without requiring an
	    internet connection. These games usually have a very straightforward path and
	    a clear conclution. 
	    <br/><br/>
	    Online games on the other hand are made to be played together with multiple
	    people over a network or the internet. These games can have straightforward
	    objectives but usually dont include a clear conclution.
	    <br/><br/>
	    Having an optimal online gaming experience typically requires a high-speed
	    Internet connection. Proper hardware will also be required, whether it's a
	    computer or a gaming console, such as Xbox® or PlayStation®, that's connected
	    to the Internet. Some Internet games require a specific piece of controlling
	    hardware, such as a joystick or a game controller. Gaming software, which could
	    be a CD or DVD that contains the gaming software or which could be available as
	    a simple download through the Internet, will also be a necessity. With some games,
	    the latest Flash software and Web browser versions will be needed.
	    <br/><br/>
	    In terms of video games, online gaming is growing in popularity for a variety of
	    reasons. Gamers can easily find opponents of a similar skill level when playing a
	    head-to-head game over the Internet. Players also can compete in massively multiplayer
	    games, where dozens of players play an ongoing game in a virtual world. Often times,
	    participants can communicate with other gamers through text chat sessions during
	    online gaming or, sometimes, players can actually speak to other players, using
	    special audio hardware.
	    <br/><br/>
	    Some online games charge a monthly fee for access to the video game software.
	    World of Warcraft (WoW) is one such game. A monthly fee might also be offered to
	    give players access to the network that helps them find and connect to other gamers
	    remotely. When joining a multiplayer game, participants will have to agree to a set
	    of rules, often called an End User License Agreement (EULA) that helps prevent conflicts
	    between players and that defines the required behavior for players. Those who violate
	    the rules will be banned from playing the game.
