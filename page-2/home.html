	  <h2>Advantages and disavantages of online games.</h2>
	  <img class="card-image" src="images/example.jpg">
	  <p>
            Online gaming is so popular because people enjoy playing games and have a need for
	    social interaction. Online games bridge this gap and therefore people love them. Even
	    thought they are so popular they don’t come with out drawbacks. Alot of online games
	    require players to spend hunders of hours playing to be able to fully enjoy these games.
	    People who do spend this time playing games aren’t able to go out and meet with people
	    face to face and thus this causes a declination in social skills, sometimes completely
	    destroying peoples social life in extreme cases.
	    <br/><br/>
	    The Internet has been a gaming medium for almost as long as it has existed,
	    as early users quickly adapted email and newsgroup technology to create online
	    versions of classic board games or roleplaying games. Since the early 2000s,
	    the growth of broadband Internet has brought new generations of gamers online;
	    in fact, you can't play some modern games such as Titanfall offline at all. While
	    there are a lot of advantages to online gaming, it does have a seedy underbelly.
	    
	    <h3>Gaming with Friends</h3>

	    More than anything else, online games have brought players together, forging people
	    with a shared interest into a community. Whether cooperative or competitive, online
	    gaming makes it much easier for gamers to play with their friends or make new ones.
	    Guildmates can play together in an online role-playing game or sports rivals test
	    their skills even though they live thousands of miles apart. Friendships can develop
	    in online games between people who would never have met otherwise. Recent research
	    even shows that children who play online games are more likely to develop positive
	    attitudes toward people from other countries and cultures.

	    <h3>Bad Behavior</h3>

	    This doesn't mean that online society is all sweetness and positive attitudes:
	    anonymity, a tense competitive environment and a low barrier to entry can encourage
	    bad behavior among some players, including both disruptive gameplay such as griefing
	    and abusive or intimidating out-of-game messages. In some extreme cases, this can
	    include bullying or threats. Game makers and community moderators do their best to
	    limit this kind of behavior, but it still plagues some online communities. Luckily,
	    most games offer a way to ignore or mute other players if you are encountering a
	    barrage of insults.

	    <h3>Whole New Genres</h3>

	    Online gaming has enabled group play on a never-before-seen scale, spawning whole
	    new genres; the immersive worlds of MMORPGs and the endless creativity of open-world
	    games would never have been possible without online gaming. The first MMORPGs
	    developed from older RPGs in the 1990s and really took off once home broadband
	    connections began to become common. While some early online games were afterthoughts
	    bolted onto single-player games, the online multiplayer game is now an important
	    genre of its own.

	    <h3>Connection Problems</h3>

	    Modern online gaming is usually a very smooth experience, but the technology still
	    has its limits. Small delays in internet connections can result in "lag," a delay
	    between when you press a button and the action occurs in the game. In input-sensitive
	    games like first-person shooters or fighting games, this small delay is the difference
	    between victory and defeat.

	    <h3>Cost</h3>

	    Internet connection charges can quickly add up when playing online: Gamers whose ISPs
	    impose data caps may find themselves using up their bandwidth quickly. Players may
	    also have to pay monthly for online accounts or spend money per item on in-game
	    purchases, and the costs can add up quickly for unsuspecting players.

	    <h3>Competitive Communities</h3>

	    Competitive gamers are among the biggest beneficiaries of online gaming. Previously,
	    most players' knowledge of the competitive scene was limited to a local group such as
	    an arcade or a university gaming club. Online gaming -- aided by other online tools
	    such as Twitch and YouTube -- has made it possible for competitive players to share
	    strategies and analyze gameplay like never before, raising the standard of play to a
	    new level and creating an entirely new industry of professional competitive gaming.
	    However, there is a downside to this boom, as new players can often find the high level
	    of play demanded by competitive gamers intimidating, and may not even attempt to play
	    online.
